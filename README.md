## üß† My Approach

I started from the official **Next.js Learn Course** tutorial and progressively refactored and extended it to build a full-featured Task Manager application:

- Adapted server components and actions to manage tasks
- Added Trello-like functionality with role separation
- Focused on clean, modular and scalable architecture
- Reused UI components and ensured a consistent minimal design
- Integrated authentication and task workflows
